    "It's just a couple of hunderd lines of python and javascript I've written on free time.\n",
    "I am planning to cleanup the code and host it on github.\n",
    "Right now the code is messy, and needs to be fixed almost everytime I use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cover more tensorflow operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Current implementaion is only for a few common tensorflow functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the library doesn't do operator overloading which is really important.\n",
    "That is, we should be able to write `X / Y`\n",
    "instead of `tf.divide(X, Y)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagrams to how operations work\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to include more details in diagrams to explain complex operation.\n",
    "For instance, we can *indicate padding, strides and kernal size\n",
    "in the diagram for convolution operation*.\n",
    "We can do similar diagrams for tensor transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the current 2-D and 3-D tensor diagrams might \n",
    "not be the best in all situations.\n",
    "It sometimes makes more sense not to show individual cells,\n",
    "butto show the sizes of the dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why I decided to show individual cells is with the intention of\n",
    "adding details like highlighted cells, kernels, etc on the same diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "![matrix](http://blog.varunajayasiri.com/ml/tf_for_beginners/matrix.png)\n",

    "it may be just enough to show the shape of the tensor in text;\n",
    "e.g. `([?, 10, 50, 20, 10])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Wrappers\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can wrap the function `squash`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    wrap(tensor(['N', 'H', 'W'])\n",
    "    def squash(s, axis=-1, epsilon=Noob(tf.constant, 1e-7), name=None):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        \n",
    "And it can display the full formula for the function and the output tensor dimensions.\n",
    "This will help us test functions before calling them, and help readers get an overview\n",
    "of the function without reading the internals. \n",
